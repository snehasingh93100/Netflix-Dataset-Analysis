# Netflix Dataset Analysis  
_A deep dive into content trends across movies and TV shows on Netflix_

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This project analyzes a dataset consisting of 7,789 records and 11 attributes about movies and TV shows available on Netflix between 2008 and 2021. Key fields include title, director, cast, country of origin, release date, rating, duration, and type (genre/type).  
The aim? To uncover how Netflix’s content distribution has evolved — by format (Movies vs. TV Shows), by genre, and by country — and to derive strategic recommendations for content planning and acquisition.

## 🧩 Problem Statement  
Although Netflix boasts a massive, global content library, the platform lacks clear analytical insight into how its catalog has changed over time. With increasing competition from Amazon Prime, Disney⁺, regional OTT platforms and more, Netflix must **strategically** analyze its content: how many Movies vs. TV Shows it offers, which genres are growing or fading, and how country-wise contributions shape its global footprint.  
This project performs a comprehensive content-trend analysis of the Netflix catalogue to identify growth areas, audience preferences and strategic opportunities for future content planning.

## 📌 Objectives  
- Analyse the distribution of Movies vs. TV Shows over the years.  
- Identify the most common genres and how their popularity has changed.  
- Compare country-wise contributions to Netflix’s catalogue.

## 🔍 Expected Outcomes  
- A clear timeline of how Netflix’s content strategy has evolved.  
- Insights into which genres perform well and which are under-represented.  
- Strategic recommendations on what types of content (by format, genre, country) Netflix should focus on moving forward.

## 📂 Dataset & Files  
- `Netflix Dataset.csv` — the main dataset containing 7,789 records across 11 columns.  
- `netflix dataset analysis project.ipynb` — the Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualisations and insights.

## 🛠 Methodology  
1. Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling missing data, parsing dates, splitting multi-value fields).  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (distribution of types, genres, countries; time-based trends).  
3. Visualisation of key trends (bar charts, line plots, heatmaps for country vs. genre etc.).  
4. Strategic interpretation & recommendation based on observed trends.

## ✅ Why This Matters  
In the streaming era, content is king — but what kind of content, and where? By understanding historical trends in format, genre and geography, Netflix (or any streaming service) can make **data-driven** decisions: invest in genres that are growing, identify gaps in regional content, or pivot between movies and shows according to audience demand.  
This kind of insight gives competitive advantage — not by guesswork, but by evidence.
